## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

The aim of this project is to build a regression model that can accurately predict diamond prices using features like:

- Carat weight
- Cut quality
- Color grade
- Clarity grade
- Physical dimensions (depth, table, x, y, z)

## ðŸ§  Model Pipeline

1. **Data Collection** â€“ Kaggle Diamond Dataset
2. **Data Cleaning & EDA** â€“ Handled missing values, outliers, and performed visualization
3. **Feature Engineering** â€“ Label encoding, scaling, and polynomial features
4. **Model Selection** â€“ Tried multiple regression algorithms:
   - Linear Regression
   - Ridge/Lasso Regression
   - Random Forest Regressor
   - XGBoost Regressor
5. **Evaluation** â€“ Based on MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² Score
6. **Model Deployment** â€“ Final model saved as `models/model.pkl` for deployment

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

- âœ… Best Model: `Random Forest Regressor`
- âœ… RÂ² Score on Test Set: `0.98+`
- âœ… MAE: `~300`
- âœ… RMSE: `~500`
